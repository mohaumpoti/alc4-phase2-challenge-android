# Travelmantics - Travel Deals app

Travelmantics is an Android App that provides information about **Travel Deals**. The App uses Firebase to manage its backend.



## Usage Instructions

1. Users can sign-up on the App using email/password or Google authentication. After successful sign-up/sign-in, a home screen like the one shown below will be presented.

2. The Toggle on the header (see images below) is intentionally placed to demonstrate to the user how the app would function in either one of **Admin Access** or **Read-only Access** roles. Obviously, this type of configuration wouldn't be ideal in a production App.

3. Lastly, when you click on any one of the Travel Deals displayed in the list, a more detailed view of a Deal will be displayed as shown below.
